# Crypt of the NecroDancer AI Project

Overview

This project aims to develop an AI that learns how to play a simplified version of the game Crypt of the NecroDancer by Brace Yourself Games. The gameplay has been re-implemented using Pygame, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes and inheritance.

The AI is trained using a genetic algorithm (GA), implemented from scratch. The genetic algorithm evolves the AI's ability to navigate the game environment and improve its performance by learning from simulated "generations" of gameplay.
